 * lustre/target/tgt_grant.c
 *
 * This file provides code related to grant space management on Lustre Targets
 * (OSTs and MDTs). Grant is a mechanism used by client nodes to reserve disk
 * space on a target for the data writeback cache. The Lustre client is thus
 * assured that enough space will be available when flushing dirty pages
 * asynchronously. Each client node is granted an initial amount of reserved
 * space at connect time and gets additional space back from target in bulk
 * write reply.
 *
 * We actually support three different cases:
 * - The client supports the new grant parameters (i.e. OBD_CONNECT_GRANT_PARAM)
 *   which means that all grant overhead calculation happens on the client side.
 *   The server reports at connect time the backend filesystem block size, the
 *   maximum extent size as well as the extent insertion cost and it is then up
 *   to the osc layer to the track dirty extents and consume grant accordingly
 *   (see osc_cache.c). In each bulk write request, the client provides how much
 *   grant space was consumed for this RPC.
 * - The client does not support OBD_CONNECT_GRANT_PARAM and always assumes a
 *   a backend file system block size of 4KB. We then have two cases:
 *   - If the block size is really 4KB, then the client can deal with grant
 *     allocation for partial block writes, but won't take extent insertion cost
 *     into account. For such clients, we inflate grant by 100% on the server
 *     side. It means that when 32MB of grant is hold by the client, 64MB of
 *     grant space is actually reserved on the server. All grant counters
 *     provided by such a client are inflated by 100%.
 *   - The backend filesystem block size is bigger than 4KB, which isn't
 *     supported by the client. In this case, we emulate a 4KB block size and
 *     consume one block size on the server for each 4KB of grant returned to
 *     client. With a 128KB blocksize, it means that 32MB dirty pages of 4KB
 *     on the client will actually consume 1GB of grant on the server.
 *     All grant counters provided by such a client are inflated by the block
 *     size ratio.
 *
 * This file handles the core logic for:
 * - grant allocation strategy
 * - maintaining per-client as well as global grant space accounting
 * - processing grant information packed in incoming requests
 * - allocating server-side grant space for synchronous write RPCs which did not
 *   consume grant on the client side (OBD_BRW_FROM_GRANT flag not set). If not
 *   enough space is available, such RPCs fail with ENOSPC
