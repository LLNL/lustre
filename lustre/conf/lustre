# Configuration options for /etc/init.d/lustre

# The command in PREEXEC_SCRIPT is run before starting services.  Its first
# parameter is mode of the init script (start|restart|condrestart).  If the
# command has a non-zero return code, then the init script will abort without
# taking any action.
#PREEXEC_SCRIPT="/usr/bin/somescript"

# The command in PREEXEC_CHECK is run before starting services.  It is not
# passed any arguments.  If the command has a non-zero return code, then the
# init script will abort without taking any action.
#PREEXEC_CHECK="command"

# The commands in POSTEXEC_SCRIPT and/or POSTEXEC_CHECK are run after starting
# services.  If the command has a non-zero return code, then the init script
# will terminate with an exit status of 1.
#POSTEXEC_SCRIPT="/usr/bin/somescript"
#POSTEXEC_CHECK="command"

# If SCSI_DEVICE_TIMEOUT is set, its value is echoed into
#  /sys/block/sdXX/device/timeout
# before checking file systems or starting Lustre
#SCSI_DEVICE_TIMEOUT=60

# LOCAL_SRV or FOREIGN_SRV can be set to a space-delimited list of
# labels that will be mounted as local and foreign (failover) lustre services.
# If unset or null, /etc/ldev.conf establishes the labels for these services.
#LOCAL_SRV="`shopt -s nullglob && cd /dev/disk/by-label 2>/dev/null && echo *-OST* *-MDT* *MGS* *MGT*`"

# Before mounting any lustre backend devices, the init script will
# run pfsck.ldiskfs only if the following FSCK_ARGS variable is a
# non-empty string.  There are no default options for this fsck.
# The command takes the form:
#
#     /sbin/pfsck.ldiskfs $devices -- ${FSCK_ARGS}
#
#FSCK_ARGS="-p"

# Uncomment to insert server mount options - see mount.lustre(8)
#MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o abort_recov"

# Stagger mounts by MOUNT_DELAY seconds to avoid possible module loading races
# due to multiple mount commands running in parallel.  This obviously does not
# eliminate the race but provides a safety buffer.  The default is 2 seconds.
# Set to 0 or empty string to disable staggering of mounts.
#MOUNT_DELAY=0

# Uncomment to disable the check for the mmp ldiskfs feature (only
# applies if foreign # devices are configured).
# REQUIRE_MMP_FEATURE=no

# Override default mount points for lustre services
#LOCAL_MOUNT_DIR=/mnt/lustre/local
#FOREIGN_MOUNT_DIR=/mnt/lustre/foreign

# Uncomment to cause the lustre init scripts to explicitly modprobe the zfs
# module when starting services.  The zfs module is normally loaded
# automatically by the zfs command line utilities, for example when the zpool
# is imported.
#LOAD_ZFS="yes"

# The following three variables configure arguments passed to the zpool_layout
# script.  This script generates the file /etc/zfs/zdev.conf which is used by
# udev to populate /dev/disk/zpool with device symlinks.  zpool_layout will
# only be run if both ZPOOL_LAYOUT_BUSES and ZPOOL_LAYOUT_PORTS are set.
#
# ZPOOL_LAYOUT_BUSES and ZPOOL_LAYOUT_PORTS identifies the PCI bus numbers and
# HBA port numbers to enumerate, respectively.  These numbers appear in the
# device names in the /dev/disk/by-path directory.
#
# ZPOOL_LAYOUT_MAP optionally specifies the path to a text file mapping slot
# numbers as reported by Linux to some alternative slot numbering scheme.  This
# can be useful if the Linux mapping does not correlate in an obvious way to
# the physical layout of the enclosure.
#ZPOOL_LAYOUT_BUSES="85 86 02 03 04"
#ZPOOL_LAYOUT_PORTS="4 0"
#ZPOOL_LAYOUT_MAP="/usr/libexec/zfs/zpool-layout/dragon.ddn.conf"
