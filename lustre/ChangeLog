Description: fix lqs' reference which won't be put in some situations
Details    : This patch fixes:
             1. In quota_check_common(), this function will check quota
                for user and group, but only send one return via "pending".
                In most cases, the pendings should be same. But that is not
                always the case.
             2. If quotaoff runs between lquota_chkquota() and
                lquota_pending_commit(), the same thing will happen too.
                That is why it comes:

       * version 1.6.5
       * Support for kernels:
	2.6.5-7.311 (SLES 9),
	2.6.9-67.0.7.EL (RHEL 4),
	2.6.16.54-0.2.5 (SLES 10),
	2.6.18-53.1.14.el5 (RHEL 5),
	2.6.22.14 vanilla (kernel.org)
       * Client support for unpatched kernels:
	 (see http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php?title=Patchless_Client)
	 2.6.16 - 2.6.22 vanilla (kernel.org)
       * Due to problems with nested symlinks and FMODE_EXEC (bug 12652),
	 we do not recommend using patchless RHEL4 clients with kernels
	 prior to 2.6.9-55EL (RHEL4U5).
       * Recommended e2fsprogs version: 1.40.7-sun1
       * Note that reiserfs quotas are disabled on SLES 10 in this kernel.
       * RHEL 4 and RHEL 5/SLES 10 clients behaves differently on 'cd' to a
	 removed cwd "./" (refer to Bugzilla 14399).
       * A new quota file format has been introduced in 1.6.5.
	 The format conversion from prior releases is handled transparently,
	 but releases older than 1.4.12/1.6.5 will not understand this new
	 format.  The automatic format conversion can be avoided by running
	 the following command on the MDS before upgrading:
		'tunefs.lustre --param="mdt.quota_type=ug1" $MDTDEV'.
	 For more information, please refer to bugzilla 13904.

	     needs to be larger than default (e.g. striped over all OSTs),
	     and an additional attribute must be stored initially in the

Severity   : critical
Frequency  : occasional, depends on client load and configuration
Bugzilla   : 12181, 12203
Description: data loss for recently-modified files
Introduced : 1.4.6
Details    : In some cases it is possible that recently written or created
	     files may not be written to disk in a timely manner (this should
	     normally be within 30s unless client IO load is very high).
	     The problem appears as zero-length files or files that are a
	     multiple of 1MB in size after a client crash or client eviction
	     that are missing data at the end of the file.

	     This problem is more likely to be hit on clients where files are
	     repeatedly created and unlinked in the same directory, clients
	     have a large amount of RAM, have many CPUs, the filesystem has
	     many OSTs, the clients are rebooted frequently, and/or the files
	     are not accessed by other nodes after being written.

	     The presence of the problem can be detected by looking at
	     /proc/sys/fs/inode-state.  If the first number (nr_inodes) is
	     smaller than the second (nr_unused) then dirty files will not
	     be flushed automatically to disk.  "sync; sleep 10" should be
	     run several times on the node before unmounting it to update
	     Lustre (this is also safe to run on nodes without this problem).

	     There is also a related kernel bug in the RHEL4 4 2.6.9 kernel
	     that can cause this same problem, so customers using that kernel
	     also need to update the kernel in addition to Lustre.  In order
	     to properly fix this bug, the RHEL3 2.4.21 kernel is also updated.

	     It is normal that files written just before a client crash (less
	     than 30s) may not yet have been flushed to disk, even for local
	     filesystems.

Bugzilla   : 5719, 9635, 9792, 9684
Description: OST (or MDS) trips assertions in (re)connection under heavy load
Details    : If a server is under heavy load and cannot reply to new
	     connection requests before the client resends the (re)connect,
	     the connection handling code can behave badly if two service
	     threads are concurrently handing separate (re)connections from

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 3627
Description: add TCP zero-copy support to kernel
Details    : Add support to the kernel TCP stack to allow zero-copy bulk
	     sends if the hardware supports scatter-gather and checksumming.
	     This allows socklnd to do client-write and server-read more
	     efficiently and reduce CPU utilization from skbuf copying.

Bugzilla   : 9326, 10402, 10897
Description: client crash in ptlrpcd_wake() thread when sending async RPC
Details    : It is possible that ptlrpcd_wake() dereferences a freed async
	     RPC.  In rare cases the ptlrpcd thread alread processed the RPC
	     before ptlrpcd_wake() was called and the request was freed.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : always for liblustre
Bugzilla   : 10290
Description: liblustre client does MDS+OSTs setattr RPC for each write
Details    : When doing a write from a liblustre client, the client
	     incorrectly issued an RPC to the MDS and each OST the file was
	     striped over in order to update the timestamps.  When writing
	     with small chunks and many clients this could overwhelm the MDS
	     with RPCs.  In all cases it would slow down the write because
	     these RPCs are unnecessary.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 9340
Description: allow number of MDS service threads to be changed at module load
Details    : It is now possible to change the number of MDS service threads
	     running.  Adding "options mds mds_num_threads={N}" to the MDS's
	     /etc/modprobe.conf will set the number of threads for the next
	     time Lustre is restarted (assuming the "mds" module is also

Bugzilla   : 10300
Description: OST crash if filesystem is unformatted or corrupt
Details    : If an OST is started on a device that has never been formatted

Bugzilla   : 10047
Description: NULL pointer deref in llap_from_page.
Details    : get_cache_page_nowait can return a page with NULL (or otherwise
	     incorrect) mapping if the page was truncated/reclaimed while it was
	     searched for. Check for this condition and skip such pages when
	     doing readahead. Introduce extra check to llap_from_page() to
	     verify page->mapping->host is non-NULL (so page is not anonymous).

Bugzilla   : 7020
Description: "page not covered by a lock" warnings from ll_readpage
Details    : sendfile called ll_readpage without right page locks present.

Bugzilla   : 10268
Description: NULL pointer deref after failed client mount
Details    : a client connection request may delayed by the network layer
	     and not be sent until after the PTLRPC layer has timed out the
	     request.  If the client fails the mount immediately it will try
	     to clean up before the network times out the request.  Add a
	     reference from the request import to the obd device and delay
	     the cleanup until the network drops the request.

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : occasionally during client (re)connect
Bugzilla   : 9387
Description: assertion failure during client (re)connect
Details    : processing a client connection request may be delayed by the
	     client or server longer than the client connect timeout.  This
	     causes the client to resend the connection request.  If the
	     original connection request is replied in this interval, the
	     client may trip an assertion failure in ptlrpc_connect_interpret()
	     which thought it would be the only running connect process.

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : only with obd_echo servers and clients that are rebooted
Bugzilla   : 10140
Description: kernel BUG accessing uninitialized data structure
Details    : When running an obd_echo server it did not start the ping_evictor
	     thread, and when a client was evicted an uninitialized data
	     structure was accessed.  Start the ping_evictor in the RPC
	     service startup instead of the OBD startup.

Bugzilla   : 10397
Description: waiting_locks_callback trips kernel BUG if client is evicted
Details    : Running with the dump_on_timeout debug flag turned on makes
	     it possible that the waiting_locks_callback() can try to dump

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : very rare (synthetic metadata workload only)
Bugzilla   : 9974
Description: two racing renames might cause an MDS thread to deadlock
Details    : Running the "racer" program may cause one MDS thread to rename
	     a file from being the source of a rename to being the target of
	     a rename at exactly the same time that another thread is doing
	     so, and the second thread has already enqueued these locks after
	     doing a lookup of the target and is trying to relock them in
	     order.  Ensure that we don't try to re-lock the same resource.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : only very large systems with liblustre clients
Bugzilla   : 7304
Description: slow eviction of liblustre clients with the "evict_by_nid" RPC
Details    : Use asynchronous set_info RPCs to send the "evict_by_nid" to
	     all OSTs in parallel.  This allows the eviction of stale liblustre
	     clients to proceed much faster than if they were done in series,
	     and also offers similar improvements for other set_info RPCs.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : common
Bugzilla   : 10265
Description: excessive CPU usage during initial read phase on client
Details    : During the initial read phase on a client, it would agressively
	     retry readahead on the file, consuming too much CPU and impacting
	     performance (since 1.4.5.8).  Improve the readahead algorithm
	     to avoid this, and also improve some other common cases (read
	     of small files in particular, where "small" is files smaller than
	     /proc/fs/lustre/llite/*/max_read_ahead_whole_mb, 2MB by default).

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : occasional, when OST network is overloaded/intermittent
Bugzilla   : 10416
Description: client evicted by OST after bulk IO timeout
Details    : If a client sends a bulk IO request (read or write) the OST
	     may evict the client if it is unresposive to its data GET/PUT
	     request.  This is incorrect if the network is overloaded (takes
	     too long to transfer the RPC data) or dropped the OST GET/PUT
	     request.  There is no need to evict the client at all, since
	     the pinger and/or lock callbacks will handle this, and the
	     client can restart the bulk request.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : Always when mmapping file with no objects
Bugzilla   : 10438
Description: client crashes when mmapping file with no objects

Severity   : Enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10482
Description: Cache open file handles on client.
Details    : MDS now will return special lock along with openhandle, if
	     requested and client is allowed to hold openhandle, even if unused,
	     until such a lock is revoked. Helps NFS a lot, since NFS is opening
	     closing files for every read/write openration.

Severity   : Enhancement
Bugzilla   : 9291

Details    : In lustre/contrib/ or /usr/share/lustre in RPM a patch for
	     MPICH is included to add Lustre-specific ADIO interfaces.
	     This is based closely on the UFS ADIO layer and only differs

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 9292
Description: Getattr by fid
Details    : Getting a file attributes by its fid, obtaining UPDATE|LOOKUP

	     silently corrupt the start of the filesystem.  CONFIG_LBD is
	     enabled for all CFS-supported kernels, but the possibility of
	     this happening with a modified kernel config exists.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10462
Description: add client O_DIRECT support for 2.6 kernels
Details    : It is now possible to do O_DIRECT reads and writes to files
	     in the Lustre client mountpoint on 2.6 kernel clients.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10446
Description: parallel glimpse, setattr, statfs, punch, destroy requests
Details    : Sends glimpse, setattr, statfs, punch, destroy requests to OSTs in
	     parallel, not waiting for response from every OST before sending
	     a rpc to the next OST.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 10150
Description: setattr vs write race when updating file timestamps
Details    : Client processes that update a file timestamp into the past
	     right after writing to the file (e.g. tar) it is possible that
	     the updated file modification time can be reset to the current
	     time due to a race between processing the setattr and write RPC.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10318
Description: Bring 'lfs find' closer in line with regular Linux find.
Details    : lfs find util supports -atime, -mtime, -ctime, -maxdepth, -print,
	     -print0 options and obtains all the needed info through the lustre
	     ioctls.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 6221
Description: support up to 1024 configured devices on one node
Details    : change obd_dev array from statically allocated to dynamically
	     allocated structs as they are first used to reduce memory usage

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 10437
Description: Flush dirty partially truncated pages during truncate
Details    : Immediatelly flush partially truncated pages in filter_setattr,
	     this way we completely avoid having any pages in page cache on OST
	     and can retire ugly workarounds during writes to flush such pages.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 10409
Description: i_sem vs transaction deadlock in mds_obd_destroy during unlink.
Details    : protect inode from truncation within vfs_unlink() context
	     just take a reference before calling vfs_unlink() and release it
	     when parent's i_sem is free.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : always, if extents are used on OSTs
Bugzilla   : 10703
Description: index ei_leaf_hi (48-bit extension) is not zeroed in extent index
Details    : OSTs using the extents format would not zero the high 16 bits of
	     the index physical block number.  This is not a problem for any
	     OST filesystems smaller than 16TB, and no kernels support ext3
	     filesystems larger than 16TB yet.  This is fixed in 1.4.7 (all
	     new/modified files) and can be fixed for existing filesystems
	     with e2fsprogs-1.39-cfs1.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 9387
Description: import connection selection may be incorrect if timer wraps
Details    : Using a 32-bit jiffies timer with HZ=1000 may cause backup
	     import connections to be ignored if the 32-bit jiffies counter
	     wraps.  Use a 64-bit jiffies counter.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : during server recovery
Bugzilla   : 10479
Description: crash after server is denying duplicate export
Details    : If clients are resending connect requests to the server, the
	     server refuses to allow a client to connect multiple times.
	     Fixed a bug in the handling of this case.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : very large clusters immediately after boot
Bugzilla   : 10083
Description: LNET request buffers exhausted under heavy short-term load
Details    : If a large number of client requests are generated on a service
	     that has previously never seen so many requests it is possible
	     that the request buffer growth cannot keep up with the spike in
	     demand.  Instead of dropping incoming requests, they are held in
	     the LND until the RPC service can accept more requests.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : Sometimes during replay
Bugzilla   : 9314
Description: Assertion failure in ll_local_open after replay.
Details    : If replay happened on an open request reply before we were able
	     to set replay handler, reply will become not swabbed tripping the
	     assertion in ll_local_open. Now we set the handler right after
	     recognising of open request

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : very rare
Bugzilla   : 10584
Description: kernel reports "badness in vsnprintf"
Details    : Reading from the "recovery_status" /proc file in small chunks
	     may cause a negative length in lprocfs_obd_rd_recovery_status()
	     call to vsnprintf() (which is otherwise harmless).  Exit early
	     if there is no more space in the output buffer.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 2259
Description: clear OBD RPC statistics by writing to them
Details    : It is now possible to clear the OBD RPC statistics by writing
	     to the "stats" file.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 10641
Description: Client mtime is not the same on different clients after utimes
Details    : In some cases, the client was using the utimes() syscall on
	     a file cached on another node.  The clients now validate the
	     ctime from the MDS + OSTs to determine which one is right.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : always
Bugzilla   : 10611
Description: Inability to activate failout mode
Details    : lconf script incorrectly assumed that in python string's numeric
	     value is used in comparisons.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : always with multiple stripes per file
Bugzilla   : 10671
Description: Inefficient object allocation for mutli-stripe files
Details    : When selecting which OSTs to stripe files over, for files with
	     a stripe count that divides evenly into the number of OSTs,
	     the MDS is always picking the same starting OST for each file.
	     Return the OST selection heuristic to the original design.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 10673
Description: mount failures may take full timeout to return an error
Details    : Under some heavy load conditions it is possible that a
	     failed mount can wait for the full obd_timeout interval,
	     possibly several minutes, before reporting an error.
	     Instead return an error as soon as the status is known.

       * version 1.4.6
       * WIRE PROTOCOL CHANGE.  This version of Lustre networking WILL NOT
	 INTEROPERATE with older versions automatically.  Please read the
	 user documentation before upgrading any part of a live system.
       * WARNING: Lustre networking configuration changes are required with
	 this release.  See https://bugzilla.clusterfs.com/show_bug.cgi?id=10052
	 for details.
       * bug fixes
       * Support for kernels:
	2.6.9-22.0.2.EL (RHEL 4)
	2.6.5-7.244 (SLES 9)
	2.6.12.6 vanilla (kernel.org)


Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7981/8208
Description: Introduced Lustre Networking (LNET)
Details    : LNET is new networking infrastructure for Lustre, it includes
	     a reorganized network configuration mode (see the user
	     documentation for full details) as well as support for routing
	     between different network fabrics.  Lustre Networking Devices
	     (LNDs) for the supported network fabrics have also been
	     created for this new infrastructure.

Severity   : enhancement
Description: Introduced Access control lists
Details    : clients can set ACLs on files and directories in order to have
	     more fine-grained permissions than the standard Unix UGO+RWX.
	     The MDS must be started with the "-o acl" mount option.

Severity   : enhancement
Description: Introduced filesystem quotas
Details    : Administrators may now establish per-user quotas on the
	     filesystem.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7982
Description: Configuration change for the XT3
	     The PTLLND is now used to run Lustre over Portals on the XT3
	     The configure option(s) --with-cray-portals are no longer used.
	     Rather --with-portals=<path-to-portals-includes> is used to
	     enable building on the XT3.  In addition to enable XT3 specific
	     features the option --enable-cray-xt3 must be used.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 7407
Description: Running on many-way SMP OSTs can trigger oops in llcd_send()
Details    : A race between allocating a new llcd and re-getting the llcd_lock
	     allowed another thread to grab newly-allocated llcd.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7116
Description: 2.6 OST async journal commit and locking fix to improve performance
Details    : The filter_direct_io()+filter_commitrw_write() journal commits for
	     2.6 kernels are now async as they already were in 2.4 kernels so
	     that they can commit concurrently with the network bulk transfer.
	     For block-allocated files the filter allocation semaphore is held
	     to avoid filesystem fragmentation during allocation.  BKL lock
	     removed for 2.6 xattr operations where it is no longer needed.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 8320
Description: lconf incorrectly determined whether two IP networks could talk
Details    : In some more complicated routing and multiple-network
	     configurations, lconf will avoid trying to make a network
	     connection to a disjoint part of the IP space.  It was doing the
	     math incorrectly for one set of cases.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 7359
Description: Fix for potential infinite loop processing records in an llog.
Details    : If an llog record is corrupted/zeroed, it is possible to loop
	     forever in llog_process().  Validate the llog record length
	     and skip the remainder of the block on error.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : occasional (liblustre only)
Bugzilla   : 6363
Description: liblustre could not open files whose last component is a symlink
Details    : sysio_path_walk() would incorrectly pass the open intent to
	     intermediate path components.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare (liblustre only with non-standard tuning)
Bugzilla   : 7201 (7350)
Description: Tuning the MDC DLM LRU size to zero triggers client LASSERT
Details    : llu_lookup_finish_locks() tries to set lock data on a lock
	     after it has been released, only do this for referenced locks

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7328
Description: specifying an (invalid) directory default stripe_size of -1
	     would reset the directory default striping
Details    : stripe_size -1 was used internally to signal directory stripe
	     removal, now use "all default" to signal dir stripe removal
	     as a directory striping of "all default" is not useful

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : common for large clusters running liblustre clients
Bugzilla   : 7198
Description: doing an ls when liblustre clients are running is slow
Details    : sending a glimpse AST to a liblustre client waits for every AST
	     to time out, as liblustre clients will not respond.  Since they
	     cannot cache data we refresh the OST lock LVB from disk instead.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7198
Description: doing an ls at the same time as file IO can be slow
Details    : enqueue and other "small" requests can be blocked behind many
	     large IO requests.  Create a new OST IO portal for non-IO
	     requests so they can be processed faster.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare (only HPUX clients mounting unsupported re-exported NFS vol)
Bugzilla   : 5781
Description: an HPUX NFS client would get -EACCESS when ftruncate()ing a newly
	     created file with mode 000
Details    : the Linux NFS server relies on an MDS_OPEN_OWNEROVERRIDE hack to
	     allow an ftruncate() as a non-root user to a file with mode 000.
	     Lustre now respects this flag to disable mode checks when
	     truncating a file owned by the user

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : liblustre-only, when liblustre client dies unexpectedly or becomes
	     busy
Bugzilla   : 7313
Description: Revoking locks from clients that went dead or catatonic might take
	     a lot of time.
Details    : New lock flags FL_CANCEL_ON_BLOCK used by liblustre makes
	     cancellation of such locks instant on servers without waiting for
	     any reply from clients. Clients drops these locks when cancel
	     notification from server is received without replying.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : liblustre-only, when liblustre client dies or becomes busy
Bugzilla   : 7311
Description: Doing ls on Linux clients can take a long time with active
	     liblustre clients
Details    : Liblustre client cannot handle ASTs in timely manner, so avoid
	     granting such locks to it in the first place if possible.  Locks
	     are taken by proxy on the OST during the read or write and
	     dropped immediately afterward.  Add connect flags handling, do
	     not grant locks to liblustre clients for glimpse ASTs.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 6252
Description: Improve read-ahead algorithm to avoid excessive IO for random reads
Details    : Existing read-ahead algorithm is tuned for the case of streamlined
	     sequential reads and behaves badly with applications doing random
	     reads.  Improve it by reading ahead at least read region, and
	     avoiding excessive large RPC for small reads.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 8330
Description: Creating more than 1000 files for a single job may cause a load
	     imbalance on the OSTs if there are also a large number of OSTs.
Details    : qos_prep_create() uses an OST index reseed value that is an
	     even multiple of the number of available OSTs so that if the
	     reseed happens in the middle of the object allocation it will
	     still utilize the OSTs as uniformly as possible.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 8322
Description: OST or MDS may oops in ping_evictor_main()
Details    : ping_evictor_main() drops obd_dev_lock if deleting a stale export
	     but doesn't restart at beginning of obd_exports_timed list
	     afterward.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7304
Description: improve by-nid export eviction on the MDS and OST
Details    : allow multiple exports with the same NID to be evicted at one
	     time without re-searching the exports list.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare, only with supplementary groups enabled on SMP 2.6 kernels
Bugzilla   : 7273
Description: MDS may oops in groups_free()
Details    : in rare race conditions a newly allocated group_info struct is
	     freed again, and this can be NULL.  The 2.4 compatibility code
	     for groups_free() checked for a NULL pointer, but 2.6 did not.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : common for liblustre clients doing little filesystem IO
Bugzilla   : 9352, 7313
Description: server may evict liblustre clients accessing contended locks
Details    : if a client is granted a lock or receives a completion AST
	     with a blocking AST already set it would not reply to the AST
	     for LDLM_FL_CANCEL_ON_BLOCK locks.  It now replies to such ASTs.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : lfs setstripe, only systems with more than 160 OSTs
Bugzilla   : 9440
Description: unable to set striping with a starting offset beyond OST 160
Details    : llapi_create_file() incorrectly limited the starting stripe
	     index to the maximum single-file stripe count.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : LDAP users only
Bugzilla   : 6163
Description: lconf did not handle in-kernel recovery with LDAP properly
Details    : lconf/LustreDB get_refs() is searching the wrong namespace

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7342
Description: bind OST threads to NUMA nodes to improve performance
Details    : all OST threads are uniformly bound to CPUs on a single NUMA
	     node and do their allocations there to localize memory access

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7979
Description: llmount can determine client NID directly from Myrinet (GM)
Details    : the client NID code from gmnalnid was moved directly into
	     llmount, removing the need to use this or specifying the
	     client NID explicitly when mounting GM clients with zeroconf

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : if client is started with down MDS
Bugzilla   : 7184
Description: if client is started with down MDS mount hangs in ptlrpc_queue_wait
Details    : Having an LWI_INTR() wait event (interruptible, but no timeout)
	     will wait indefinitely in ptlrpc_queue_wait->l_wait_event() after
	     ptlrpc_import_delayed_req() because we didn't check if the
	     request was interrupted, and we also didn't break out of the
	     event loop if there was no timeout

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 5047
Description: data loss during non-page-aligned writes to a single file from
	     both multiple nodes and multiple threads on one node at same time
Details    : updates to KMS and lsm weren't protected by common lock. Resulting
	     inconsistency led to false short-reads, that were cached and later
	     used by ->prepare_write() to fill in partially written page,
	     leading to data loss.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : always, if lconf --abort_recovery used
Bugzilla   : 7047
Description: lconf --abort_recovery fails with 'Operation not supported'
Details    : lconf was attempting to abort recovery on the MDT device and not
	     the MDS device

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 9445
Description: remove cleanup logs
Details    : replace lconf-generated cleanup logs with lustre internal
	     cleanup routines.  Eliminates the need for client-cleanup and
	     mds-cleanup logs.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 8592
Description: add support for EAs (user and system) on lustre filesystems
Details    : it is now possible to store extended attributes in the Lustre
	     client filesystem, and with the user_xattr mount option it
	     is possible to allow users to store EAs on their files also

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7293
Description: Add possibility (config option) to show minimal available OST free
	     space.
Details    : When compiled with --enable-mindf configure option, statfs(2)
	     (and so, df) will return least minimal free space available from
	     all OSTs as amount of free space on FS, instead of summary of
	     free spaces of all OSTs.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7311
Description: do not expand extent locks acquired on OST-side
Details    : Modify ldlm_extent_policy() to not expand local locks, acquired
	     by server: they are not cached anyway.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : when mmap is used/binaries executed from Lustre
Bugzilla   : 9482
Description: Unmmap pages before throwing them away from read cache.
Details    : llap_shrink cache now attempts to unmap pages before discarding
	     them (if unmapping failed - do not discard).  SLES9 kernel has
	     extra checks that trigger if this unmapping is not done first.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 6034
Description: lconf didn't resolve symlinks before checking to see whether a
	     given mountpoint was already in use

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : when migrating failover services
Bugzilla   : 6395, 9514
Description: When migrating a subset of services from a node (e.g. failback
	     from a failover service node) the remaining services would
	     time out and evict clients.
Details    : lconf --force (implied by --failover) sets the global obd_timeout
	     to 5 seconds in order to quickly disconnect, but this caused
	     other RPCs to time out too quickly.  Do not change the global
	     obd_timeout for force cleanup, only set it for DISCONNECT RPCs.

Severity   : enhancement
Frequency  : if MDS is started with down OST
Bugzilla   : 9439,5706
Description: Allow startup/shutdown of an MDS without depending on the
	     availability of the OSTs.
Details    : Asynchronously call mds_lov_synchronize during MDS startup.
	     Add appropriate locking and lov-osc refcounts for safe
	     cleaning.  Add osc abort_inflight calls in case the
	     synchronize never started.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : occasional (Cray XT3 only)
Bugzilla   : 7305
Description: root not authorized to access files in CRAY_PORTALS environment
Details    : The client process capabilities were not honoured on the MDS in
	     a CRAY_PORTALS/CRAY_XT3 environment.  If the file had previously
	     been accessed by an authorized user then root was able to access
	     the file on the local client also.  The root user capabilities
	     are now allowed on the MDS, as this environment has secure UID.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : occasional
Bugzilla   : 6449
Description: ldiskfs "too long searching" message happens too often
Details    : A debugging message (otherwise harmless) prints too often on
	     the OST console.  This has been reduced to only happen when
	     there are fragmentation problems on the filesystem.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 9598
Description: Division by zero in statfs when all OSCs are inactive
Details    : lov_get_stripecnt() returns zero due to incorrect order of checks,
	     lov_statfs divides by value returned by lov_get_stripecnt().

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : common
Bugzilla   : 9489, 3273
Description: First write from each client to each OST was only 4kB in size,
	     to initialize client writeback cache, which caused sub-optimal
	     RPCs and poor layout on disk for the first writen file.
Details    : Clients now request an initial cache grant at (re)connect time
	     and so that they can start streaming writes to the cache right
	     away and always do full-sized RPCs if there is enough data.
	     If the OST is rebooted the client also re-establishes its grant
	     so that client cached writes will be honoured under the grant.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : common
Bugzilla   : 7198
Description: Slow ls (and stat(2) syscall) on files residing on IO-loaded OSTs
Details    : Now I/O RPCs go to different portal number and (presumably) fast
	     lock requests (and glimses) and other RPCs get their own service
	     threads pool that should be able to service those RPCs
	     immediatelly.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7417
Description: Ability to exchange lustre version between client and servers and
	     issue warnings at client side if client is too old. Also for
	     liblustre clients there is ability to refuse connection of too old
	     clients.
Details    : New 'version' field is added to connect data structure that is
	     filled with version info. That info is later checked by server and
	     by client.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : rare, liblustre only.
Bugzilla   : 9296, 9581
Description: Two simultaneous writes from liblustre at offset within same page
	     might proceed at the same time overwriting eachother with stale
	     data.
Details    : I/O lock withing llu_file_prwv was released too early, before data
	     actually was hitting the wire. Extended lock-holding time until
	     server acknowledges receiving data.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : extremely rare. Never observed in practice.
Bugzilla   : 9652
Description: avoid generating lustre_handle cookie of 0.
Details    : class_handle_hash() generates handle cookies by incrementing
	     global counter, and can hit 0 occasionaly (this is unlikely, but
	     not impossible, because initial value of cookie counter is
	     selected randonly). Value of 0 is used as a sentinel meaning
	     "unassigned handle" --- avoid it. Also coalesce two critical
	     sections in this function into one.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 9528
Description: allow liblustre clients to delegate truncate locking to OST
Details    : To avoid overhead of locking, liblustre client instructs OST to
	     take extent lock in ost_punch() on client's behalf. New connection
	     flag is added to handle backward compatibility.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 4928, 7341, 9758
Description: allow number of OST service threads to be specified
Details    : a module parameter allows the number of OST service threads
	     to be specified via "options ost ost_num_threads={N}" in the
	     OSS's /etc/modules.conf or /etc/modprobe.conf.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 6146, 9635, 9895
Description: servers crash with bad pointer in target_handle_connect()
Details    : In rare cases when a client is reconnecting it was possible that
	     the connection request was the last reference for that export.
	     We would temporarily drop the export reference and get a new
	     one, but this may have been the last reference and the export
	     was just destroyed.  Get new reference before dropping old one.

Severity   : enhancement
Frequency  : if client is started with failover MDS
Bugzilla   : 9818
Description: Allow multiple MDS hostnames in the mount command
Details    : Try to read the configuration from all specified MDS
	     hostnames during a client mount in case the "primary"
	     MDS is down.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 9297
Description: Stop sending data to evicted clients as soon as possible.
Details    : Check if the client we are about to send or are sending data to
	     was evicted already. (Check is done every second of waiting,
	     for which l_wait_event interface was extended to allow checking
	     of exit condition at specified intervals).

Severity   : minor

Bugzilla   : 1443
Description: unlinked inodes were kept in memory on the client
Details    : If a client is repeatedly creating and unlinking files it
	     can accumulate a lot of stale inodes in the inode slab cache.
	     If there is no other client load running this can cause the

Bugzilla   : 4180, 6984, 7171, 9963, 9331
Description: OST becomes very slow and/or deadlocked during object unlink
Details    : filter_destroy() was holding onto the parent directory lock
	     while truncating+unlinking objects.  For very large objects this
	     may block other threads for a long time and slow overall OST
	     responsiveness.  It may also be possible to get a lock ordering
	     deadlock in this case, or run out of journal credits because of
	     the combined truncate+unlink.  Solution is to do object truncate
	     first in one transaction without parent lock, and then do the
	     final unlink in a new transaction with the parent lock.  This
	     reduces the lock hold time dramatically.

Severity   : major

Bugzilla   : 9967
Description: MDS or OST cleanup may trip kernel BUG when dropping kernel lock
Details    : mds_cleanup() and filter_cleanup() need to drop the kernel lock
	     before unmounting their filesystem in order to avoid deadlock.
	     The kernel_locked() function in 2.4 kernels only checks whether

Bugzilla   : 9919
Description: fix echo_client to work with OST preallocated code
Details    : OST preallocation code (5137) didn't take echo_client IO path
	     into account: echo_client calls filter methods outside of any
	     OST thread and, hence, there is no per-thread preallocated
	     pages and buffers to use. Solution: hijack pga pages for IO. As
	     a byproduct, this avoids unnecessary data copying.

Description: Client can oops in mdc_commit_close() after open replay
Details    : It was possible for the MDS to return an open request with no
	     transaction number in mds_finish_transno() if the client was
	     evicted, but without actually returning an error.  Clients
	     would later try to replay that open and may trip an assertion

Bugzilla   : 10076
Description: OST may deadlock under high load on fragmented files
Details    : If there was a heavy load and highly-fragmented OST filesystems
	     it was possible to have all the OST threads deadlock waiting on
	     allocation of biovecs, because the biovecs were not released
	     until the entire RPC IO was completed.  Instead, release biovecs

Bugzilla   : 7138
Description: Client will block write RPCs if not enough grant
Details    : If a client has max_dirty_mb smaller than max_rpcs_in_flight,

       * bug fixes

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare (only unsupported configurations with a node running as an
	     OST and a client)
Bugzilla   : 6514, 5137
Description: Mounting a Lustre file system on a node running as an OST could
	     lead to deadlocks
Details    : OSTs now preallocates memory needed to write out data at
	     startup, instead of when needed, to avoid having to
	     allocate memory in possibly low memory situations.
	     Specifically, if the file system is mounted on on OST,
	     memory pressure could force it to try to write out data,
	     which it needed to allocate memory to do.  Due to the low
	     memory, it would be unable to do so and the node would
	     become unresponsive.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 7015
Description: Addition of lconf --service command line option
Details    : lconf now accepts a '--service <arg>' option, which is
             shorthand for 'lconf --group <arg> --select <arg>=<hostname>'

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 6101
Description: Failover mode is now the default for OSTs.
Details    : By default, OSTs will now run in failover mode.  To return to
             the old behaviour, add '--failout' to the lmc line for OSTs.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 1693
Description: Health checks are now provided for MDS and OSTs
Details    : Additional detailed health check information on MSD and OSTs
             is now provided through the procfs health_check value.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : occasional, depends on IO load
Bugzilla   : 4466
Description: Disk fragmentation on the OSTs could eventually cause slowdowns
             after numerous create/delete cycles
Details    : The ext3 inode allocation policy would not allocate new inodes
             very well on the OSTs because there are no new directories
             being created.  Instead we look for groups with free space if
             the parent directories are nearly full.

Severity   : major
Bugzilla   : 6302
Frequency  : rare
Description: Network or server problems during mount may cause partially
             mounted clients instead of returning an error.
Details    : The config llog parsing code may overwrite the error return
             code during mount error handling, returning success instead
             of an error.

Severity   : minor
Bugzilla   : 6422
Frequency  : rare
Description: MDS can fail to allocate large reply buffers
Details    : After long uptimes the MDS can fail to allocate large reply
	     buffers (e.g. zconf client mount config records) due to memory
	     fragmentation or consumption by the buffer cache.  Preallocate
	     some large reply buffers so that these replies can be sent even
	     under memory pressure.

Severity   : minor
Bugzilla   : 6266
Frequency  : rare (liblustre)
Description: fsx running with liblustre complained that using truncate() to
             extend the file doesn't work.  This patch corrects that issue.
Details    : This is the liblustre equivalent of the fix for bug 6196.  Fixes
             ATTR_SIZE and lsm use in llu_setattr_raw.

Severity   : critical
Bugzilla   : 6866
Frequency  : rare, only 2.6 kernels
Description: Unusual file access patterns on the MDS may result in inode
             data being lost in very rare circumstances.
Details    : Bad interaction between the ea-in-inode patch and the "no-read"
             code in the 2.6 kernel caused the inode and/or EA data not to
             be read from disk, causing single-file corruption.

Severity   : critical
Bugzilla   : 6998
Frequency  : rare, only 2.6 filesystems using extents
Description: Heavy concurrent write and delete load may cause data corruption.
Details    : It was possible under high-load situations to have an extent
             metadata block in the block device cache from a just-unlinked
             file overwrite a newly-allocated data block.  We now unmap any
             metadata buffers that alias just-allocated data blocks.

Severity   : minor
Bugzilla   : 7241
Frequency  : filesystems with default stripe_count larger than 77
Description: lconf+mke2fs fail when formatting filesystem with > 77 stripes
Details    : lconf specifies an inode size of 4096 bytes when the default
             stripe_count is larger than 77.  This conflicts with the default
             inode density of 1 per 4096 bytes.  Allocate smaller inodes in
             this case to avoid pinning too much memory for large EAs.

Bugzilla   : 6172
Description: Client is evicted, gets IO error writing to file
Details    : lock ordering changes for bug 5492 reintroduced bug 3267 and
             caused clients to be evicted for AST timeouts.  The fixes in
             bug 5192 mean we no longer need to have such short AST timeouts
             so ldlm_timeout has been increased.

Severity   : major

Bugzilla   : 6200
Description: A bug in MDS/OSS recovery could cause the OSS to fail an assertion
Details    : There's little harm in aborting MDS/OSS recovery and letting it
             try again, so I removed the LASSERT and return an error instead.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 5902
Description: New debugging infrastructure for tracking down data corruption
Details    : The I/O checksum code was replaced to: (a) control it at runtime,
             (b) cover more of the client-side code path, and (c) try to narrow
             down where problems occurred

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 3819, 4364, 4397, 6313
Description: Racing close and eviction MDS could cause assertion in mds_close
Details    : It was possible to get multiple mfd references during close and
             client eviction, leading to one thread referencing a freed mfd.

Severity:  : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 3262, 6359
Description: Attempts to reconnect to servers are now more aggressive.
Details    : This builds on the enhanced upcall-less recovery that was added
             in 1.4.2.  When trying to reconnect to servers, clients will
             now try each server in the failover group every 10 seconds.  By
             default, clients would previously try one server every 25 seconds.

Severity   : major

Bugzilla   : 6371
Description: After recovery, certain operations trigger a failed
             assertion on a client.
Details    : Failing over an mds, using lconf -d --failover, while a
             client was doing a readdir() call would cause the client to
             LBUG after recovery completed and the readdir() was resent.

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : Clusters with multiple interfaces not on the same subnet
Bugzilla   : 5541
Description: Nodes will repeatedly try to reconnect to an interface which it
             cannot reach and report an error to the log.
Details    : Extra peer list entries will be created by lconf with some peers
             unreachable.  lconf now validates the peer before adding it.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : Only if a default stripe is set on the filesystem root.
Bugzilla   : 6367
Description: Setting a default stripe on the filesystem root prevented the
             filesystem from being remounted.
Details    : The client was sending extra request flags in the root getattr
             request and did not allocate a reply buffer for the dir EA.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : occasional, higher if lots of files are accessed by one client
Bugzilla   : 6159, 6097
Description: Client trips assertion regarding lsm mismatch/magic
Details    : While revalidating inodes the VFS looks up inodes with ifind()
             and in rare cases can find an inode that is being freed.
             The ll_test_inode() code will free the lsm during ifind()
             when it finds an existing inode and then the VFS later attaches
             this free lsm to a new inode.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 6422, 7030
Description: MDS deadlock between mkdir and client eviction
Details    : Creating a new file via mkdir or mknod (starting a transaction
             and getting the ns lock) can deadlock with client eviction
             (gets ns lock and trying to finish a synchronous transaction).

Severity   : minor
Frequency  : occasional
Description: While starting a server, the fsfilt_ext3 module could not be
             loaded.
Details    : CFS's improved ext3 filesystem is named ldiskfs for 2.6
             kernels.  Previously, lconf would still use the ext3 name
             when trying to load modules.  Now, it will correctly use
             ext3 on 2.4 and ldiskfs on 2.6.

Severity   : enhancement
Description: The default stripe count has been changed to 1
Details    : The interpretation of the default stripe count (0, to lfs
             or lmc) has been changed to mean striping across a single
             OST, rather than all available.  For general usage we have
             found a stripe count of 1 or 2 works best.

Severity   : enhancement

Bugzilla   : 6409, 6834
Description: Creating files with an explicit stripe count may lead to
             a failed assertion on the MDS
Details    : If some OSTs are full or unavailable, creating files may
             trigger a failed assertion on the MDS.  Now, Lustre will
             try to use other servers or return an error to the
             client.

Description: Multiple concurrent overlapping read+write on multiple SMP nodes
             caused lock timeout during readahead (since 1.4.2).
Details    : Processes doing readahead might match a lock that hasn't been
             granted yet if there are overlapping and conflicting lock
             requests.  The readahead process waits on ungranted lock
             (original lock is CBPENDING), while OST waits for that process
             to cancel CBPENDING read lock and eventually evicts client.

Description: Initial enabling of flock support for clients
Details    : Implements fcntl advisory locking and file status functions.
	     This feature is provided as an optional mount flag (default
	     off), and is NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED.  Not all types of record
	     locking are implemented yet, and those that are are not guaranteed
	     to be completely correct in production environments.

Description: OSTs running 2.4 kernels but with extents enabled might trip an
             assertion in the ext3 JBD (journaling) layer.
Details    : The b_committed_data struct is protected by the big kernel lock
             in 2.4 kernels, serializing journal_commit_transaction() and
             ext3_get_block_handle->ext3_new_block->find_next_usable_block()
             access to this struct.  In 2.6 kernels there is finer grained
             locking to improve SMP performance of the JBD layer.
