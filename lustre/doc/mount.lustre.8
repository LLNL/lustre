.TH mount.lustre 8 "2008 Mar 15" Lustre "configuration utilities"
.SH NAME
mount.lustre \- start a Lustre client or target service 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.BI "mount \-t lustre [\-o " options "] " directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mount.lustre
is used to start a Lustre client or target service.  This program should not be
called directly; rather it is a helper program invoked through 
.BR mount (8)
as above.  Lustre clients and targets are stopped by using the 
.BR umount (8)
command.
.br

There are two forms for the 
.I device
option, depending on whether a client or a target service is started:
.TP
.IR <mgsspec> :/ <fsname>
mounts the Lustre filesystem named
.I fsname
on the client by contacting the Management Service at 
.IR mgsspec 
on the pathname given by
.IR directory .
The format for
.I mgsspec
is defined below.  A mounted client filesystem appears in
.BR fstab (5)
and is usable like any local filesystem and provides a full
POSIX-compilant interface.
.TP
.I disk_device
starts the target service defined by the 
.I mkfs.lustre
command on the physical disk
.IR disk_device .  
A mounted target service filesystem is only useful for
.BR df (1)
operations and appears in
.BR fstab (5)
to show the device is in use.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI <mgsspec>:= <mgsnode>[:<mgsnode>]
The mgs specification may be a colon-separated list of nodes:
.TP
.BI <mgsnode>:= <mgsnid>[,<mgsnid>]
each node may be specified by a comma-separated list of NIDs.
.PP
In addition to the standard options listed in
.BR mount (8),
Lustre understands the following
.B client-specific
options:
.TP
.BI flock
Enable full flock support, coherent across all client nodes.
.TP
.BI localflock
Enable local flock support, using only client-local flock (faster, for applications that require flock but do not run on multiple nodes).
.TP
.BI noflock
Disable flock support entirely.  Applications calling flock will get an error.
.TP
.BI user_xattr
Enable get/set of extended attributes by regular users.  See the
.BR attr (5)
manual page.
.TP
.BI nouser_xattr
Disable use of extended attributes by regular users.  Root and system processes can still use extended attributes.
.TP
.BI acl
Enable POSIX Access Control List support.  See the
.BR acl (5)
manual page.
.TP
.BI noacl
Disable Access Control List support.
.TP
.BI verbose
Enable mount/umount console messages.
.TP
.BI noverbose
Disable mount/umount console messages.
.PP
In addition to the standard mount options and backing disk type
(e.g. ext3) options listed in
.BR mount (8),
Lustre understands the following
.B server-specific
options:
.TP
.BI nosvc
Only start the MGC (and MGS, if co-located) for a target service, and not the actual service.
.TP
.BI nomgs
Start a MDT with a co-located MGS without starting the MGS.
.TP
.BI exclude= ostlist
Start a client or MDT with a (colon-separated) list of known inactive OSTs.
.TP
.BI abort_recov
Abort client recovery and start the target service immediately.
.TP
.BI md_stripe_cache_size
Sets the stripe cache size for server side disk with a striped raid
configuration.
.TP
.BI recovery_time_soft= timeout
Allow 'timeout' seconds for clients to reconnect for recovery after a server
crash.  This timeout will be incrementally extended if it is about to expire
and the server is still handling new connections from recoverable clients.
The default soft recovery timeout is set to 300 seconds (5 minutes).
.TP
.BI recovery_time_hard= timeout
The server will be allowed to incrementally extend its timeout up to a hard
maximum of 'timeout' seconds.  The default hard recovery timeout is set to
900 seconds (15 minutes).
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B mount -t lustre cfs21@tcp0:/testfs /mnt/myfilesystem
Start a client for the Lustre filesystem 'testfs' at the mount point
/mnt/myfilesystem. The Management Service is running on a node reachable
from this client via the nid cfs21@tcp0.
.TP
.B mount -t lustre /dev/sda1 /mnt/test/mdt
Start the Lustre metadata target service from /dev/sda1 on mountpoint /mnt/test/mdt.
.TP
.B mount -t lustre -L testfs-MDT0000 -o abort_recov /mnt/test/mdt
Start the testfs-MDT0000 service (by using the disk label), but abort the
recovery process.
.SH NOTES
If the Service Tags tool (from the sun-servicetag package) can be found in
/opt/sun/servicetag/bin/stclient an inventory service tag will be created
reflecting the Lustre service being provided.  If this tool cannot be found
.B mount.lustre
will silently ignore it and no service tag is created.  The
.BR stclient (1)
tool only creates the local service tag.  No information is sent to the asset
management system until you run the Registration Client to collect the tags
and then upload them to the inventory system using your inventory system account.
See https://inventory.sun.com/ for more details on a web-based, free, IT asset
management system.
.SH BUGS
Not very many mount options can be changed with
.BR "-o remount" .
