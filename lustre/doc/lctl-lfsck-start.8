.SH DESCRIPTION
Start LFSCK on the specified MDT or OST device with specified parameters.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B  -M, --device <MDT,OST_device>
The MDT or OST device to start LFSCK/scrub on. If "-M" option is not specified,
it will select the available Lustre device on current server automatically.
But under the following cases you need to specify the device (see "-M" option)
explicitly: if there are multiple devices on current server those belong to
different Lustre filesystems, or if "-A" option is not specified and there are
multiple devices on current server.
.TP
.B  -A, --all
Start LFSCK on all available devices in the system by single LFSCK command.
Such LFSCK command can be executed on any MDT deivce in the system.
.TP
.B  -c, --create-ostobj [on | off]
Create the lost OST-object for dangling LOV EA: 'off' (default) or 'on'. Under
default mode, when the LFSCK find some MDT-object with dangling reference, it
will report the inconsistency but will not repair it.  If 'on' is given, then
LFSCK will re-create the missed OST-object.
.TP
.B  -C, --create-mdtobj [on | off]
Create the lost MDT-object for dangling name entry: 'off' (default) or 'on'.
Under default mode, when the LFSCK find dangling name entry, it will report
the inconsistency but will not repair it.  If 'on' is given, then LFSCK will
re-create the missed MDT-object.
.TP
.B  -e, --error <error_handle>
With error_handle as 'abort' then if the repair of a file is not possible, then
LFSCK will save the current position stop with an error.  Otherwise the default
behavior is to 'continue' if the repair of a file is not possible.
.TP
.B  -h, --help
Show the usage message.
.TP
.B  -n, --dryrun [on | off]
Perform a trial run with no changes made, if 'on' or no argument is given.
Default is 'off', meaning that any inconsistencies found will be repaired.
.TP
.B  -o, --orphan
Handle orphan objects, such as orphan OST-objects for layout LFSCK by
linking them under the .../.lustre/lost+found directory.
.TP
.B  -r, --reset
Set the current position of object iteration to the beginning of the specified
device. The non-specified parameters will also be reset to the default. By
default the iterator will resume the scanning from the last saved checkpoint
position, and other unspecified parameters will be the same as the prior
incomplete run.
.TP
.B  -s, --speed <speed_limit>
Set the upper limit of LFSCK processing in objects per second to reduce load
on the servers and storage. If no value is specified the saved value is used
(if resuming from a checkpoint). Otherwise the default value of 0 is used,
which means check the filesystem as quickly as possible.
.TP
.B  -t, --type <lfsck_type[,lfsck_type...]>
The type of LFSCK checking/repair to execute. If no type is given and the
previous run was incomplete or internal consistency checks detected an error,
then the same types are used for the next run. Otherwise, the default is to
check all types of consistency. Any time LFSCK is triggered on an ldiskfs
MDT or OST then OI Scrub is run. Valid types are a comma-separated list of one or more of:
.B scrub
to run only the local OI Scrub on ldiskfs targets,
.B namespace
for FID-in-dirent and linkEA checking on the MDT(s),
.B layout
for MDT-OST cross-reference consistency, and
.B all
to run all of the available check types.
.TP
.B  -w, --window-size <size>
Specifies the maximum number of in-flight request being processed at
one time.  This controls the load placed on remote OSTs when running
.B layout
checks.  By default there are at most 1024 outstanding requests.
