This directory is a catch-all location for useful contributed files and
scripts that are _not_ part of the lustre package proper.  For
instance, scripts that are useful to lustre developers, but not used
by lustre's own build system in configuring, compiling, or packaging lustre.

An example would be the git hook scripts.  We do not package these files,
and while they are an important part of the lustre development process
they are not an essential part of the lustre build system.
