LU-553 build: improve checks for commit-msg

Improve the checks done by the commit-msg script.  It now ensures
that all the parts of the commit message are present.
- validate that the Change-Id: generated from 'git hash-object' is
  not empty, since this can happen if git is unhappy with the options
- check for only one Change-Id: line (multiple Signed-off-by: OK)
- describe the "component:" field better, with examples

If there was an error committing the message, save a copy to a
temporary file, so that it can be edited and re-used, instead of
having to recreate it each time, or fetch it from .git/COMMIT_MSG.
